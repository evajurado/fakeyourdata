When working with data, one of the problems that can be encountered is the difficulty of accessing real datasets, even internally in a company where, for data protection reasons, information cannot be shared between departments. 
Performing predictive models becomes a complex task where, in many cases, the data has to pass masking processes or even its use is limited to dummy data.
This tool aims to generate fake data based on real data using Deep Learning algorithms based on GAN networks. 
This solution allows tabular data to be synthesized so that the variables' distributions of the original dataset remain the same and the relationships between variables is kept. 
Additional use cases might be the improvement of unbalanced or low-quality datasets to be used in Machine Learning models as well as in scenarios where there is no significant volume of training data.
